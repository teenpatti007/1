# MovieHub — Free Movies for Kodi

MovieHub is a Kodi video addon that lets you browse and stream a curated
catalogue of movies and web series. Access is protected by a **4-digit
subscription passcode** that is **locked to a single device** — one code works
on only one Kodi installation.

## Install

**Via repository (recommended, auto-updates):**
Kodi's "Add source" needs a browsable web address, so use **GitHub Pages**.

1. On GitHub, repo `teenpatti007/1` → **Settings → Pages** → Deploy from a
   branch → **main** → **/ (root)** → Save.
2. Kodi → **Settings (gear) → File manager → Add source → `<None>`**.
3. Enter:
   ```
   https://teenpatti007.github.io/1/MovieHub/docs/repo/
   ```
4. Name it `MovieHub Repo`, then **OK**.
5. **Settings → Add-ons → Install from zip file → MovieHub Repo** → install
   `repository.moviehub.zip`.
6. **Settings → Add-ons → Install from repository → MovieHub Repository →
   Video add-ons → MovieHub → Install**.

**Via ZIP (no auto-update):**
1. Download `plugin.video.moviehub.zip` onto the Kodi device.
2. **Settings → Add-ons → Install from zip file** → select the zip.
3. MovieHub appears under **Video → MovieHub**.

## First launch

Open **MovieHub** and enter the **4-digit access code** you were given. The code
is linked to this device and is re-checked on every launch. A code already used
on another device is rejected — contact your provider for a fresh code.

## Using MovieHub

- **Latest** — newest movies, with a **`>> Next Page`** item at the bottom.
- **Genres / Categories** — browse by category (also supports Next Page).
- **Search** — find a movie by name.
- **Play** — pick a title, choose a source, and it resolves and plays. HLS
  (`.m3u8`) uses `inputstream.adaptive`; direct MP4s play natively.

## Settings

Open **MovieHub → (long-press / context menu) → Settings**.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Preferred quality | Auto | Auto / 1080p / 720p / 480p / 360p for source picking |
| Maximum sources | 20 | How many stream sources to list per movie |
| Use inputstream.adaptive | On | Use `inputstream.adaptive` for HLS playback |
| Resolve timeout (s) | 25 | How long to wait when resolving a stream |
| Enable debug logging | Off | Write extra info to the Kodi log |

## Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot connect to server"** — make sure GitHub Pages is enabled and the
  Kodi source is the directory URL `https://teenpatti007.github.io/1/MovieHub/docs/`
  (not a raw file link).
- **HLS won't play** — ensure `inputstream.adaptive` is installed/enabled and
  *Use InputStream Adaptive* is On.
- **No sources / "unresolved"** — the source site may be down or blocked by
  your ISP; try another source or a VPN.
- **Code rejected** — codes are single-device; ask your provider for a new one.
